It uses historical analysis to examine press reports of the Occupation of Wounded Knee by the American Indian Movement (AIM) from March 27\textendash May 8, 1973. Coverage from national, mid-western, and Native American newspapers is compared for triangulation. Historical documents and Agenda Building and Framing theories are examined. This thesis is important because of the profound impact that the press has in shaping national attitudes about significant Civil Rights issues.    Initial coverage sympathized with AIM, though press favor faded. Press agents grew impatient with news blackouts and the lack of ``newsworthy'' material. Polls also indicated diminishing public support. Though early reports received front-page attention, only subsequent updates including injury or death found prominent placement. Frequency and placement improved at the event's conclusion. Final reports were laced with resentment toward the costly occupation.},

The author's work, part political intrigue, part labor history, with large doses of American music, film, and TV lore, makes new sense of the 1970s as a crucial and poorly understood transition from the optimism of New Deal America to the widening economic inequalities and dampened expectations of the present. It takes us from the factory floors of Cleveland, Pittsburgh, and Detroit to the Washington of Nixon, Ford, and Carter. The author connects politics to culture, showing how the big screen and the jukebox can help us understand how America turned away from the radicalism of the 1960s and toward the patriotic promise of Ronald Reagan. He makes unexpected connections between the secrets of the Nixon White House and the failings of the George McGovern campaign, between radicalism and the blue collar backlash, and between the earthy twang of Merle Haggard's country music and the falsetto highs of Saturday Night Fever. He also captures nothing less than the defining characteristics of a new era, and asserts that the 1970s were the last stand of the American working class, a time when the goals of the New Deal finally faded away to make room for Reaganomics and a widening of the gap between classes. This is a book that attempts to define a misunderstood decade.},

Puritan-inspired stories of national origins and Turnerian frontier narratives cast Indians as outsiders whose role was to be dispossessed and then disappear. More recent counter-narratives of conquest and of redemptive struggles for citizenship allow Native actors important and autonomous roles, but are also premised on a teleology of assimilation and civil rights that flattens the complexity of Indian uses of U.S. citizenship rights. The history of the Society of American Indians, founded in 1911, shows how the paradox of Indian citizenship is central to stories about the broader sweep of U.S. historical practice.},

That message echoed the agency's depiction of the African American Civil Rights Movement and allowed the USIA to recognize Indian resistance to assimilation. It offered little room for tribal nationhood, however, during these early years of the modern American Indian political revival.},

The history of the gay and lesbian left reveals a far different story: a movement whose radicals understood their sexual liberation as interdependent with solidarity against imperialism, war, and racism. The gay and lesbian left was born in the late 1960s but flourished up through the end of the Cold War and the depths of the AIDS epidemic. Its participants argued that anti-imperialism and anti-militarism were necessary to sexual liberation and that sexual liberation was key to revolutionary change. Across the 1970s, gay and lesbian leftists embraced socialist and women of color feminism and organized opposition to U.S. militarism and the New Right. In the Reagan years they challenged U.S. intervention in Central America, collaborated with their peers in Nicaragua, and mentored the first direct action against AIDS. The gay and lesbian left found its center in the San Francisco Bay Area, where it networked queer, radical, and Central American communities. Gay and lesbian leftists built queer politics through radical internationalism and crafted a vision for sexual freedom that moved beyond liberal or neoliberal inclusion in the United States.},

  abstract = {Scholarship on American Indian urbanization and the Bureau of Indian Affairs' mid-t\-wentieth-c\- entury ``voluntary relocation program'' often characterizes native relocatees as hapless victims. The disastrous side of urban relocation is well documented: Indian Bureau promises lured native people away from their pastoral reservation existence and tossed them into the maelstrom of urban life, where they struggled to come to terms with modernity. Such accounts were true for many Indian migrants, but not all. Indeed, many native relocatees played an active and informed role in both accepting relocation's challenge and affecting the program's eventual outcome. By focusing attention on Indian appeals for urban industrial work opportunities both during and after World War II, this article contextualizes the relocation program within a larger trend of native people willingly embracing off-r\- eservation employment as a necessary, if not always desirable, means toward supporting their families when reservation economies (and the Indian Bureau) failed them. Such a perspective challenges any notion that native people en masse were passive victims of what were at times nefarious schemes of federal policy makers. To be sure, thousands of Indians did suffer against the backdrop of an undeniably mismanaged program. Numerous relocatees, however, succeeded in using relocation not only as a means to improve their immediate economic prospects but also as an opportunity to clear a path for a generation of young Indians who used greater exposure to the off-\-reservation world as an avenue toward better education and economic opportunities. Drawing on handwritten letters from native people, relocation subject files, oral histories, and archival sources, this article is an attempt at a fresh analysis of both what was at stake for hopeful Indian relocatees and their attitudes toward the potential benefits and pitfalls of urban migration.},

As diplomats, entertainers, traders, travelers, and, sadly, most often when enslaved, Indigenous people operated consciously within structures that spanned the ocean and created a worldview that was framed in transatlantic terms. Focusing on purposeful travelers of ``Aztec'' (Central Mexican) origin, this article uses the distinctive context of the 1500s to rewrite our understandings of the Atlantic world. In the turbulent waters of early empire, we can more easily see Native people as purposeful global actors who created and transformed social, economic, political, and intellectual networks, forging not one but many ``Indigenous Atlantics.'' This is about more than ``looking east from Indian country,'' or recovering the transatlantic journeys of Native people, important though both those things are. To find a truly ``Indigenous Atlantic,'' we must reimagine the history of the ocean itself: as a place of Indigenous activity, imagination, and power.},

The development and refinement of the Army's domestic support role, as well as the disciplined manner in which the Army conducted these complex and often unpopular tasks, are major themes of this volume. In addition, the study demonstrates the Army's progress in coordinating its operational and contingency planning with the activities of other federal agencies and the National Guard. --from the Foreword.},

  abstract = {In this article, I examine the role of the "Indian Country" heritage metaphor in U.S. military activities in the Middle East from a critical anthropological perspective. Research has revealed the proliferation of such discourse among soldiers, military strategists, reporters, and World Wide Web users to refer to hostile, unsecured, and dangerous territory in Iraq and Afghanistan. The salience of this symbol in 21st-century U.S. armed conflicts attests to its staying power in national narratives of colonialism at home and abroad. Summoning the "Indian wars" of the 19th century in the U.S. West as malleable symbolic parallels to the current war in Iraq serves to offer combat lessons in guerilla warfare while reinscribing epic stories of U.S. military imperialism and renarrating uncritically the struggles and conflicts of Native Americans, past and present, through the lens of contemporary perspectives on terrorism.},

  shorttitle = {Like a Hurricane},
  author = {Smith, Paul Chaat and Warrior, Robert Allen},
  year = {1996},
  abstract = {It's the mid-1960's, and everyone is fighting back. Black Americans are fighting for civil rights, the counterculture is trying to subvert the Vietnam War, and women are fighting for their liberation. Indians were fighting, too, though it's a fight too few have documented, and even fewer remember. At the time, newspapers and television broadcasts were filled with images of Indian activists staging dramatic events such as the seizure of Alcatraz in 1969, the storming of the Bureau of Indian Affairs building on the eve of Nixon's re-election in 1972, and the American Indian Movement (AIM)-supported seizure of Wounded Knee by the Oglala Sioux in 1973. Like a Hurricane puts these events into historical context and provides one of the first narrative accounts of that momentous period. Unlike most other books written about American Indians, this book does not seek to persuade readers that government polices were cruel and misguided. Nor is it told from the perspective of outsiders looking in. Written by two American Indians, Paul Chaat Smith and Robert Allen Warrior, Like a Hurricane is a gripping account of how for a brief, but brilliant season, Indians strategized to change the course and tone of American Indian-U.S. government interaction. Unwaveringly honest, it analyzes not only the period's successes but also its failures.},

Two indigenous communities in the Valley of Oaxaca attempted to lay claim to disputed territory by presenting these competing ``titles,'' ostensibly written in the s, to Spanish authorities in the s. The titles present each community's account of the Spanish Conquest of Oaxaca and subsequent colonial events. We consider how the documents shed light on Mixtec and Nahua ethnic identity and historical memory in the Valley of Oaxaca in the late colonial period.},

These myths reflected contemporary racial perceptions of American Indians, thus denying American Indian's ownership of the land and their rightful place in history. Furthermore, the histories of the mounds serve as a modern-day warning against nationalism and pseudo-history for political purposes.},

  abstract = {This book seeks to step outside the simple stories of Indian/white relations--stories of conquest and assimilation and stories of cultural persistence. It is, instead, about a search for accommodation and common meaning. It tells how Europeans and Indians met, regarding each other as alien, as virtually nonhuman, and how between 1650 and 1815 they constructed a common, mutually comprehensible world in the region around the Great Lakes that the French called the "Pays d'en haut". Here the older worlds of the Algonquins and various Europeans overlapped, and their mixture created new systems of meaning and of exchange. Finally, the book tells of the breakdown of accommodation and common meanings and the recreation of the Indians as alien and exotic. The process of accommodation described in this book takes place in a middle ground, a place in between cultures and peoples, and in between empires and non-state villages. On the middle ground people try to persuade others who are different than themselves by appealing to what they perceive to be the values and practices of those others. From the creative misunderstandings that result, there arise shared meanings and new practices.},
